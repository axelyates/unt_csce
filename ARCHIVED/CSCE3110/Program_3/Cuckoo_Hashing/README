This is contingent on having "raw_int.txt" in the same directory.
This program uses redirected input as a means to take in data.

How to run program:

Step 1:
    Compile it by running "g++ cuckoo.cpp" without the quotation marks.

Step 2:
    Run "./a.out < raw_int.txt > output" without the quotation marks.

    /*
    What this does is place all of the redirected output into a single file.
    Also, you can name the file whatever you'd like.
    */

Step 3:
    To view output use "vi output" without the quotation marks.

    /*
    Or whichever editor you'd like, this works with nano, vim, etc.
    */

Step 4:
    Have a great day and feel free to give me an A.

    As an aside, with the changes to the program late I wasn't sure what needed to be
    printed out and what didn't so I went ahead and printed out everything. I
    apologize if this isn't right but I wanted to have my bases covered anyway and
    show that I knew what I was doing. Thanks for understanding.
