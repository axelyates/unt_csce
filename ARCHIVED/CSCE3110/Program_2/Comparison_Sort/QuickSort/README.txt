This README goes with my implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm over the "pop_density.txt" file.

Step 1:
    Make sure that "pop_density.txt" and the mergesort.cpp file are in the same directory

Step 2:
    Enter "g++ *.cpp" (without the quotes) into the terminal

Step 3:
    Enter "./a.out < pop_density.txt > pop_density_sorted.txt" (without the quotes) into the terminal

Step 4:
    Give me an A :)
