// This will be an "algorithm" based upon a Fortran program 
// I wrote years ago before I knew what I was doing.

// We have scraps of tape with Air Pollution data on it, due to
// our instrumented plane crashing.  I was to sort the data by
// time.

    for each year from 1978 .. 1979
        for each month from 1 to 12
            for each day from 1 to 31
                for each hour from 1 to 24
                    for each minute from 1 to 60
                        for each second from 1 to 60

                             read each tape fragment and iff
                             the time on the fragment matched
                             the "time" made up of loop indices
                                      print the data to our sorted
                                      output file.
