MRS. DALLOWAY SAID SHE WOULD BUY THE FLOWERS HERSELF.
FOR LUCY HAD HER WORK CUT OUT FOR HER. THE DOORS WOULD BE TAKEN OFF THEIR
HINGES; RUMPELMAYER'S MEN WERE COMING. AND THEN, THOUGHT CLARISSA DALLOWAY,
WHAT A MORNING - FRESH AS IF ISSUED TO CHILDREN ON A BEACH.
WHAT A LARK! WHAT A PLUNGE! FOR SO IT HAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO HER, WHEN, WITH A
LITTLE SQUEAK OF THE HINGES, WHICH SHE COULD HEAR NOW, SHE HAD BURST OPEN THE
FRENCH WINDOWS AND PLUNGED AT BOURTON INTO THE OPEN AIR. HOW FRESH, HOW CALM,
STILLER THAN THIS OF COURSE, THE AIR WAS IN THE EARLY MORNING; LIKE THE FLAP
OF A WAVE; THE KISS OF A WAVE; CHILL AND SHARP AND YET (FOR A GIRL OF
EIGHTEEN
AS SHE THEN WAS) SOLEMN, FEELING AS SHE DID, STANDING THERE AT THE OPEN
WINDOW,
THAT SOMETHING AWFUL WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN; LOOKING AT THE FLOWERS, AT THE
TREES
WITH THE SMOKE WINDING OFF THEM AND THE ROOKS RISING, FALLING; STANDING AND
LOOKING UNTIL PETER WALSH SAID, "MUSING AMONG THE VEGETABLES?"-
WAS THAT IT?-"I PREFER MEN TO CAULIFLOWERS"- WAS THAT IT?
