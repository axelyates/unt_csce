#define  NUM_OF_SETS 5

/*   The above specifies the number of sets that will be used in "this"
     version of main.C.   Since main.C will make an array of Set(s) for
     either the Characteristic Vector version of the program OR the
     list implementation of Sets you won't actually need to worry about this
     unless you want to do bounds checking to make sure neither your program
     nor mine exceeds the array bounds.
